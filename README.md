# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project is a simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The model is trained on a dataset of images containing people with and without masks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Face Mask Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset) by Omkar Gurav, which contains over 7,000 images of people with and without masks.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

I've installed these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy  94% on the test set.

Below is the results of the code for predicting the images:
